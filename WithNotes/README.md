This contains detailed notes. Not good for readability, but for info.

If you prefer readability, check CleanCode directory

## _Tips_: 

1. First, read all codes from this directory and understand how each function need each other across files
2. After reading the CleanCode directory, go to WithNotes directory for more detailed version of noting and documentation.
You may find this directory a little bit difficult to read and navigate, but if you already understand the code and functionality from the CleanCode directory, then the WithNotes directory shouldn't be a problem.
