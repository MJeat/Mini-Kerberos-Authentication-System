# Mini-Kerberos-Authentication-System

The main objective of the Mini Kerberos Authentication System is to design and demonstrate a secure authentication mechanism that verifies user identities and grants access to network services without exposing passwords. The system aims to implement the core principles of the Kerberos protocol such as confidentiality, integrity, and mutual authentication through the use of encrypted tickets and session keys.

Specifically, the goal is to:
- Simulate the interaction between the Authentication Server (AS), Ticket Granting Server (TGS), and File Server within a Key Distribution Centre (KDC).
- Ensure that users are authenticated securely before accessing protected resources.
- Prevent unauthorized access and replay attacks by using time-stamped, encrypted tokens.
- Provide an educational model to understand how Kerberos enhances trust and security in distributed systems.
