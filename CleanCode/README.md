This is the cleaned version of the entire coding system of this project. There are some comments for noting and giving info on the function and its role and responsibility.

## _Tips_: 

1. First, read all codes from this directory and understand how each function need each other across files
2. After reading the CleanCode directory, go to WithNotes directory for more detailed version of noting and documentation.
You may find this directory a little bit difficult to read and navigate, but if you already understand the code and functionality from the CleanCode directory, then the WithNotes directory shouldn't be a problem.
